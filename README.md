# Roundcube 1.0.0 &lt;= 1.2.2 Remote Code Execution

Roundcube is a widely distributed open-source webmail software used by many organizations and companies around the globe. The mirror on SourceForge, for example, counts more than 260,000 downloads in the last 12 months which is only a small fraction of the actual users. Once Roundcube is installed on a server, it provides a web interface for authenticated users to send and receive emails with their web browser.

In Roundcube 1.2.2, and earlier, user-controlled input flows unsanitized into the fifth argument of a call to PHP's built-in function mail() which is documented as security critical. The problem is that the invocation of the mail() function will cause PHP to execute the sendmail program. The fifth argument allows to pass arguments to this execution which allows a configuration of sendmail. Since sendmail offers the -X option to log all mail traffic in a file, an attacker can abuse this option and spawn a malicious PHP file in the webroot directory of the attacked server. The following code lines trigger the vulnerability.
